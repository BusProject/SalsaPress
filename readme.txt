Connects WordPress to Salsa for embedding events, sign up forms, and reports.

== Description ==

SalsaPress connects your WordPress bllog to [Salsa](http://salsalabs.com), allowing you to embed sign up forms, events, and reports into your WordPress site.

* Coming Events Widget
* Event Sign Up Form Widget
* Petitions Widget
* Embeddable Reports, Sign Up Forms, Events, and Petitions
* Filtering of Salsa Data by Chapter
* Filtering of Events by Template
* Translatable - including strings from Salsa like field names

Coming Soon: Browsable Event Calendar
