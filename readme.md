Salsa Press
=============

Salsa Press is a plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) that connects to [Salsa](http://salsalabs.com).

All Salsa accounts can use Salsa's API -- no activation is required. First-time users may want to go to [this page](https://salsasupport.zendesk.com/entries/23514381-Definitions-for-common-terms) in Salsa's documentation to learn how to retrieve the API hostname that Salsa Press needs. If you have questions about this document, or Salsa in general, please do contact [Salsa Support](mailto:support@salsalabs.com).

Contribute

HELL YES. Fork away. We're going to be managing the source on github and will move stable versions to the WordPress host.

The code could use some more markup to explain what's going on so if you've got a question, don't hesitate to [email](mailto:srduncombe@gmail.com) or leave a request or a question.
